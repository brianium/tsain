Use the following skills together for this task:
- clojure-eval
- frontend-design
- component-iterate
  
You will use the chrome extension to design components at localhost:3000 with the sandbox environment we have set up
You will start a new repl before we start. Confirm the sandbox is visible before you start iterating on components.
Once the sandbox component is visible, I want you to pause and ask me for the thematic direction and set of components I want you to work on
The goal is to have you iterate on components until you are satisfied. Components support variants. 
Once you are satisfied, use the REPL and dev/commit! to commit the component so it is available in the gallery
